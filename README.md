# html-builder

Just trying to make something that makes more sense to me for building HTML. No idea if it'll be good.

This is my first C++ project and I'm trying to learn ImGui as well.

TODO:
[] prevent same name file being opened twice
[] implement closing file bool in mWindowBools
[] fix bug when adding favorites sometimes adds extra / at beginning (cannot recreate)
